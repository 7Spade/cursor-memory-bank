# VAN PROTOCOL

> **TL;DR:** When user types "VAN", respond with "OK VAN" and ensure critical files exist. Then start the standard workflow.

## üöÄ QUICK START RESPONSE

When the user types ONLY "VAN", immediately respond:

```
OK VAN

I'll check for the critical files:

## FILE VERIFICATION
[ ] .cursorrules
[ ] memory-bank directory
[ ] docs/archive directory

Checking these now...
```

## üìã FILE VERIFICATION PROCESS

Check for critical files and create them if missing:

1. Ensure `.cursorrules` exists (as a file, not directory)
2. Ensure `memory-bank` directory exists
3. Ensure `docs/archive` directory exists
4. Ensure all core Memory Bank files exist, including tasks.md

## ‚úÖ VERIFICATION RESPONSE

After verification, show results:

```
## FILE VERIFICATION
[X] .cursorrules - created/exists
[X] memory-bank directory - created/exists
[X] docs/archive directory - created/exists
[X] Core Memory Bank files - created/exist

All critical files are now in place. What task would you like me to work on?
```

## üîÑ WITH TASK INCLUDED

When user includes a task with VAN:
```
VAN
I need to implement a login system
```

Respond with:

```
OK VAN

## INITIALIZATION
Task: Implement Login System
Objective: Create secure user authentication functionality

## FILE VERIFICATION
[X] Critical files checked/created

## PLATFORM DETECTION
Current environment: [Windows/Mac/Linux]

## Section Progress
[ ] 1. INITIALIZATION
[ ] 2. DOCUMENTATION SETUP 
[ ] 3. TASK PLANNING
[ ] 4. IMPLEMENTATION
[ ] 5. REFLECTION
[ ] 6. ARCHIVING

## Verification Commitment
I WILL run the full verification checklist before completing this task.
I will maintain tasks.md as the single source of truth for task status.

I'll begin by reviewing/creating the Memory Bank files...
```

## üìù MEMORY BANK FILES

The core Memory Bank files (ALL REQUIRED):
- projectbrief.md
- productContext.md
- systemPatterns.md
- techContext.md
- activeContext.md
- progress.md
- tasks.md - SINGLE SOURCE OF TRUTH for all task tracking

## ‚úì VAN CHECKPOINT

Before proceeding after VAN:
- Have I verified all critical files exist?
- Have I created tasks.md if it doesn't exist?
- Have I identified the operating system?
- Have I set up the section tracking?
- Have I made the verification commitment mentioning tasks.md?
- Am I ready to start the workflow?
