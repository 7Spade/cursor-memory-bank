# ADAPTIVE TASK TRACKING PROTOCOL

> **TL;DR:** Use tasks.md as the SINGLE SOURCE OF TRUTH for all task tracking. The task tracking process scales based on task complexity from Level 1 (quick bug fixes) to Level 4 (complex systems).

## üö® SINGLE SOURCE OF TRUTH RULE

Tasks.md is the ONLY file that should contain task status tracking:
- Use [ ] for pending tasks
- Use [X] for completed tasks

## üìù TASKS.MD STRUCTURE

```markdown
# Project Tasks

## Current Tasks
- [ ] Task 1: Description and details
  - [ ] Subtask 1.1
  - [ ] Subtask 1.2
- [ ] Task 2: Description and details

## Completed Tasks
- [X] Task 3: Completed on YYYY-MM-DD
- [X] Task 4: Completed on YYYY-MM-DD
```

## üîÑ ADAPTIVE TASK TRACKING BY LEVEL

### Level 1: Quick Bug Fix
**Update Frequency:** 2-3 updates total
- Initial bug documentation
- Fix implementation
- Verification of fix

**Tracking Detail:**
- Single task with 1-3 checkboxes
- Focus on problem statement and solution
- Minimal but sufficient documentation

**Example Task Entry:**
```markdown
## Current Tasks
- [ ] Fix login button not working
  - [ ] Identify root cause
  - [ ] Implement fix
  - [ ] Verify solution
```

**Example Update Format:**
```
üîÑ TASK UPDATE: Fix login button - [X] Complete

```

### Level 4: Complex System
**Update Frequency:** 15+ updates total
- After each workflow section
- Formal checkpoints within sections
- Major architectural decisions
- Integration points
- Testing phases
- Security and performance reviews
- Final system verification

**Tracking Detail:**
- Comprehensive hierarchical task structure (10+ items)
- Dependencies and relationships documented

- Multiple testing stages
- Performance and security considerations

**Example Task Entry:**
```markdown
## Current Tasks
- [ ] Implement OAuth2 authentication system

```

## üîÑ CREATIVE PHASE HANDLING

For tasks requiring extended creative work:

1. **Mark Creative Phase Start:**
```
======== ENTERING CREATIVE PHASE ========
Focus: [UI design/Algorithm development/Architecture planning]
```

2. **Update at Creative Checkpoints:**
```
üîÑ CREATIVE CHECKPOINT: [Milestone reached]
- Key decisions made:
  - [Decision 1]
  - [Decision 2]
- Next creative milestone: [Description]
```

3. **Mark Creative Phase End:**
```
======== EXITING CREATIVE PHASE - UPDATING TASKS ========

üîÑ TASK UPDATE: [Task name] - [Status]
- Updated in tasks.md ‚úì
- Creative work completed:
  - [Summary of creative output]
- Implementation details added to activeContext.md ‚úì
```

## üîÑ REAL-TIME UPDATES

During implementation, add updates to activeContext.md:

```
üîÑ UPDATE: [Component] - [Status]
Added to activeContext.md:
- [Brief details of implementation]
```

### Level-Specific Update Frequency:

| Level | Description | Update Frequency | Detail Level |
|-------|-------------|------------------|-------------|
| 1     | Bug Fix     | Major milestones only | Basic |
| 2     | Simple Enhancement | Key steps | Standard |
| 3     | Intermediate Feature | Regular defined points | Detailed |
| 4     | Complex System | Comprehensive at formal checkpoints | Extensive |

## ‚úì TASK VERIFICATION CHECKPOINT

Before completing any task, regardless of level:
```
‚úì TASK VERIFICATION:
- Task status updated in tasks.md? [YES/NO]
- Implementation details added to activeContext.md? [YES/NO]
- Progress reflected in progress.md? [YES/NO]
```

## üîÑ TASK ESCALATION PROTOCOL

If a task proves more complex than initially categorized:

1. Document the escalation need:
```
‚ö†Ô∏è TASK ESCALATION NEEDED
Current Level: [Level X]
Recommended Level: [Level Y]
Reason: [Brief explanation]
```

2. If escalation is approved:
```
üîÑ TASK ESCALATION: [Task name]
- Updated task complexity to Level [Y] ‚úì
- Expanded task breakdown in tasks.md ‚úì
- Adjusted documentation requirements ‚úì
```

3. If escalation is not approved:
```
‚ö†Ô∏è CONTINUING AT CURRENT LEVEL
Note: Task complexity exceeds current level.
Limitations: [Document what may be compromised]
```

This adaptive approach eliminates redundancy while maintaining comprehensive task tracking through a single source of truth that adapts to the complexity of the task.
