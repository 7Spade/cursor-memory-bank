# SIMPLIFIED TASK TRACKING PROTOCOL

> **TL;DR:** Use tasks.md as the SINGLE SOURCE OF TRUTH for all task tracking. Other files should reference tasks but not duplicate status information.

## 🚨 SINGLE SOURCE OF TRUTH RULE

Tasks.md is the ONLY file that should contain task status tracking:
- Use [ ] for pending tasks
- Use [X] for completed tasks

## 📝 TASKS.MD STRUCTURE

```markdown
# Project Tasks

## Current Tasks
- [ ] Task 1: Description and details
  - [ ] Subtask 1.1
  - [ ] Subtask 1.2
- [ ] Task 2: Description and details

## Completed Tasks
- [X] Task 3: Completed on YYYY-MM-DD
- [X] Task 4: Completed on YYYY-MM-DD
```

## 🔄 TASK UPDATE PROCESS

When updating a task status:

1. Update tasks.md with status change
2. Reference (don't duplicate) in other files

```
🔄 TASK UPDATE: [Task name] - [X] Complete/[ ] Pending
- Updated in tasks.md ✓
- Referenced in activeContext.md ✓
```

## 📋 REFERENCE FORMAT FOR OTHER FILES

### In activeContext.md:
```markdown
## Current Focus
Current task: [Task name] (see tasks.md)
Recent updates:
- [Component] implemented
- Working on [specific aspect]
```

### In progress.md:
```markdown
## Implementation Progress
- [Component] - Completed, see tasks.md for details
- [Component] - In progress, see tasks.md for details
```

### In .cursorrules:
```markdown
# Project Intelligence
(No task tracking - only project patterns)

## Project Patterns
- [Pattern 1]: [Description]
- [Pattern 2]: [Description]
```

## 🔄 REAL-TIME UPDATES

During implementation, add updates to activeContext.md:

```
🔄 UPDATE: [Component] - [Status]
Added to activeContext.md:
- [Brief details of implementation]
```

## ✓ TASK VERIFICATION CHECKPOINT

Before completing any task:
```
✓ TASK VERIFICATION:
- Task status updated in tasks.md? [YES/NO]
- Implementation details added to activeContext.md? [YES/NO]
- Progress reflected in progress.md? [YES/NO]
```

This simplified approach eliminates redundancy while maintaining comprehensive task tracking through a single source of truth.
