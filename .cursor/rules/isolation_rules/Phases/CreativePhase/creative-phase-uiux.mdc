# CREATIVE PHASE: UI/UX DESIGN

> **TL;DR:** This document outlines the structured approach for UI/UX design decisions during the Creative Phase. It ensures user-centric designs, exploration of multiple options, adherence to a style guide (if available or created), and clear documentation of UI/UX choices, aligning with React/Tailwind best practices.

## üé® UI/UX Design Philosophy

* **User-Centricity**: Designs must prioritize the user's needs, goals, and context.
* **Clarity & Simplicity**: Interfaces should be intuitive and easy to understand.
* **Consistency**: Maintain consistency with established design patterns, project-specific styles, and platform conventions.
* **Accessibility (A11y)**: Adhere to WCAG guidelines to ensure usability for people with disabilities.
* **Efficiency**: Enable users to accomplish tasks with minimal effort.
* **Feedback**: Provide clear and timely feedback for user actions.
* **Visual Cohesion**: Ensure new UI elements align with the existing or defined project style guide.

## üåä UI/UX Design Workflow

This workflow guides the UI/UX design process within the Creative Phase, incorporating a crucial style guide check.

## Style Guide Integration
A consistent visual style is paramount for good UI/UX. This section details how to reference an existing style guide or prompt for its creation.

Step 0: Style Guide Check & Handling
A. Checking for an Existing Style Guide:

Default Location Check: The system will first look for style-guide.md or design-system.md in:
docs/style-guide.md
The project root: style-guide.md
(Future Enhancement: A predefined Memory Bank variable for the style guide path).
Ask the User: If not found automatically, prompt:
"I couldn't automatically locate a project style guide. Is there an existing style guide I should reference? If so, please provide the file path or URL. Otherwise, we can create a basic one or proceed without (not recommended)."
B. Using an Existing Style Guide:

If a style guide is provided or found:
Load its content into context.
CRITICAL: All subsequent UI/UX design proposals (colors, typography, spacing, component appearance) MUST adhere strictly to this guide.
When evaluating options (Step 6), "Adherence to Style Guide" becomes a key criterion.
C. If No Style Guide Exists or is Provided (User Interaction):

The system should strongly recommend creating one:
"No style guide has been referenced. For optimal UI consistency and development efficiency, creating even a basic style guide is highly recommended."

"Would you like to:"
"1. Create a basic style guide now? (I can help you define core elements like colors, typography, and spacing based on observations or your input.)"
"2. Provide a path/URL to an existing style guide if you know one?"
"3. Proceed with UI/UX design without a style guide? (This may lead to inconsistencies and is not recommended for new features.)"
"Please choose 1, 2, or 3."
D. Assisting in Style Guide Creation (If user opts-in for option 1):
This initiates a sub-process to define and document a basic style guide.

    StartCreate["User Opts to Create Style Guide"] --> GatherInspiration["Gather Inspiration<br>(e.g., Analyze existing UI, user-provided image/description)"]
    GatherInspiration --> DefineColors["Define Core Color Palette<br>(Primary, Secondary, Accent, Neutrals, Status Colors - with hex codes)"]
    DefineColors --> DefineTypography["Define Typography<br>(Font Families, Sizes, Weights for Headings, Body, Links)"]
    DefineTypography --> DefineSpacing["Define Spacing System<br>(Base unit, margins, paddings, Tailwind scale usage)"]
    DefineSpacing --> DefineComponents["Define Key Component Styles (Conceptual)<br>(Buttons, Inputs, Cards - using Tailwind utility classes if applicable)"]
    DefineComponents --> DefineTone["Define Tone of Voice & Imagery Style (Optional)"]
    DefineTone --> GenerateDoc["Generate 'docs/style-guide.md' File<br>(Populate with defined elements)"]
    GenerateDoc --> Confirm["Confirm Style Guide Creation & Proceed with UI/UX Design"]

```
### Process:

Inspiration: If an image (like the dashboard example) or existing UI parts are available, analyze them for common styles. Otherwise, ask the user for preferences.
AI: "To create a style guide, do you have an existing design, screenshot, or website I can analyze for styles? Or would you like to define them from scratch?"
Colors: Extract or ask for primary, secondary, accent, neutral, and status colors.
AI: "Based on [inspiration/your input], I've identified/suggest these colors: Primary: #XXXXXX. Is this correct? What about secondary and accent colors?"
Typography: Extract or ask for font families, base font size, and scale.
AI: "The main font appears to be a [Sans-Serif type]. Do you have a specific font name? What's the base font size?"
Spacing: Extract or ask for base spacing unit or Tailwind scale usage.
AI: "I observe [consistent padding/margin patterns]. Shall we adopt an 8px base unit system, or stick to Tailwind's spacing scale (e.g., p-4, m-2)?"
Key Components: For common components, define their general appearance or key Tailwind classes.
AI: "For a primary button, the style seems to be [describe observed style, e.g., 'bg-yellow-400 text-black rounded-lg']. Does this capture it?"
Documentation: Generate a docs/style-guide.md file. (A sample template for this file was created in our previous interaction based on the image).
Once the style guide is created/loaded, it becomes the single source of truth for visual design for the remainder of the project.

üñºÔ∏è Key UI/UX Design Considerations (To be applied using the Style Guide)
1. User Needs Analysis
Personas: Define target user personas.
User Stories/Jobs-to-be-Done: Clarify what users need to achieve.
Use Cases: Detail specific interaction scenarios.
2. Information Architecture (IA)
Content Inventory & Audit: Understand existing content.
Hierarchy & Structure: Organize content logically.
Navigation Design: Design intuitive navigation (menus, breadcrumbs) adhering to style guide for appearance.
Labeling: Use clear and consistent labels.
3. Interaction Design (IxD)
User Flows: Map out the user's path.
Wireframes: Create low-fidelity layouts.
Prototypes (Conceptual): Describe interactive elements and transitions.
Error Handling & Prevention: Design clear error messages (styled per guide).
Feedback Mechanisms: Implement visual/textual feedback (styled per guide).
4. Visual Design (Strictly follow the Style Guide)
Style Guide Adherence: CRITICAL - All visual choices MUST conform to docs/style-guide.md.
Visual Hierarchy: Use Style Guide's typography and spacing to guide the user.
Layout & Composition: Arrange elements effectively using Tailwind CSS and style guide spacing.
Typography: Apply defined font families, sizes, and weights from the Style Guide.
Color Palette: Exclusively use colors defined in the Style Guide.
Imagery & Iconography: Use icons and images that match the Style Guide's defined style.
Branding: Align with project branding guidelines as documented in the Style Guide.
5. Accessibility (A11y)
WCAG Compliance Level: Target AA or AAA.
Semantic HTML.
Keyboard Navigation.
ARIA Attributes.
Color Contrast: Verify against Style Guide colors.
Alternative Text.
6. Platform & Responsiveness
Responsive Design: Ensure UI adapts to screen sizes using Style Guide's responsive principles (if defined).
Platform Conventions: Adhere to UI patterns for the target platform(s).
